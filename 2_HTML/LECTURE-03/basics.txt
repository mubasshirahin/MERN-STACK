Website -> Collection of webpages
Webapps -> Run in Browser but gives a interface of an mobile app.

Why we use index.html .Why not ahin.html
-> We use index.html because it is the default file that web servers look for when a user visits a website without specifying a file name. When we deploy a website,
 the server needs an entry point to load the application. By convention, most web servers automatically serve index.html as the starting page.
It is not because index.html has higher priority, but because it is the standard default filename configured on most servers.
